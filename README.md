# Power Morphicon Planner

Using the data on the PMC website, I created a more user-friendly, accessible and searchable panel/photo ops schedule using what I've learned in React so far.

For comments, suggestions and typo reports and changes, please reach out to my Twitter.

For more details on changes and updates, please see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

NOTE: Will soon change the repository name to remove '2024'.

See you at the con!!
